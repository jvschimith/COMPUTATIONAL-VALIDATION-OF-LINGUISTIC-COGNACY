# COMPUTATIONAL-VALIDATION-OF-LINGUISTIC-COGNACY

The linguistic affiliation of the ancient Xiongnú and Huns remains a subject of debate in historical linguistics, with hypotheses spanning Turkic, Mongolic, and Yeniseian families. This project leverages **Graph Machine Learning (ML)** to computationally validate the recent hypothesis proposed by Bonmann and Fries \cite{Bonmann2025Xiongnu}, suggesting a direct linguistic link between the Xiongnú/Huns and the Paleo-Siberian Yeniseian language family (specifically, Arin). By constructing a **weighted graph** where nodes represent languages and edge weights quantify shared cognates, we apply the **Node2Vec** graph embedding algorithm \cite{Grover2016Node2Vec}. Subsequent visualization using **t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)** \cite{VanDerMaaten2008TSNE} demonstrates that the Xiongnú and Huns nodes cluster tightly with the Yeniseian languages (Arin, Ket, Yugh), providing a quantitative, geometry-based confirmation of the linguistic proximity established via the traditional comparative method
